# About this repository
This is a list of different resources that I found to be the most useful when I started out the respective topics. Its a collection of resources which I would work with if I would have to start over, including recommendations on which steps to take first.

This repository is still work in progress. I intend to add more elaborate comments on all resources and with different learning paths depending on your background and interests. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me, always happy to help :)

# About myself
I am a Statistics Master student at ETH Zurich. I come from an economics & business background and initially started teaching myself programming, statistics, machine learning, working with the cloud, the basics of good software development during my time at university. Since finishing my Bachelor's degree and especially now at university I find myself taking pleasure in trying to understand some topics bottom up. I spend a lot of time going through many resources and this is an attempt to structure these for myself and for others.
